I implemented a function pairings() and frequency_count() for question 2 part a
and part b respectively. 

All the test methods are within test mod and are labelled by functions are being
tested. First is the test code for pairings() and frequency_count() which are in
the form pairings_test_<num>() and frequency_count_test_<num>(). The next
section includes test methods for vectors and hash maps in the form
<method>_test_vec() and <method>_test_hash() respectively. 

All the methods are tested with cargo.
All methods of options and results are implemented with cargo.
